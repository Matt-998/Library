# Library

![Alt text](<matt-998.github.io_library_ (1).png>)

This is my Library app currently with no local storage. In this project i used objects and constructors consciously for the first time as well as getting more practice with general vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.

See the <a href="https://matt-998.github.io/library/" target="_blank">Live Demo</a>
